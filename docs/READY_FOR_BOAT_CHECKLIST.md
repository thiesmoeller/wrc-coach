# Ready for Real Boat - Pre-Launch Checklist ‚úì

## Quick Pre-Launch Check (30 seconds)

### 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Demo Mode Status
Open the app and verify:

- [ ] **NO orange warning banner** at top of screen
- [ ] Header shows "Ready" (NOT "Demo Mode")

If you see orange banner ‚Üí Click "Switch to Real Sensors" button!

### 2. üì± Phone Setup
- [ ] Phone fully charged (or charging cable ready)
- [ ] Airplane mode OFF (need GPS!)
- [ ] Screen lock disabled (or set to long timeout)
- [ ] Phone in waterproof case (recommended)

### 3. üéØ Orientation Setting
- [ ] Open Settings (‚ò∞)
- [ ] Set "Phone Orientation" correctly:
  - **Rower (facing stern)** ‚Üê Most common
  - Coxswain (facing bow)

### 4. üìä App State
- [ ] No session currently recording
- [ ] Storage space available (check Sessions panel)

## Detailed Settings Verification

### Open Settings Panel (press 'S' or click ‚ò∞)

#### Calibration (Optional for first use)
- Phone calibration can be done later
- Skip for now if just recording data

#### Visualization
- History Strokes: Any value (2 is good default)
- Trail Opacity: Any value (40% is good default)
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è These only affect display, not recorded data

#### Stroke Detection
- Catch Threshold: 0.6 m/s¬≤ (default)
- Finish Threshold: -0.3 m/s¬≤ (default)
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Can tune these later based on real data

#### Data Recording ‚≠ê IMPORTANT
- [ ] Display Sample Rate: 20 FPS (default is fine)
- [ ] **Demo Mode: UNCHECKED** ‚Üê Critical!
- [ ] See message: "‚úì Using real phone sensors"
- [ ] Phone Orientation: Set to your position

## On-Water Recording Workflow

### Starting a Session
1. Click **Sessions** button
2. Click **New Session** (green button)
3. Verify you see red "Recording" indicator in header
4. Place phone in secure location in boat
5. Start rowing!

### During Recording
- Keep screen on (prevents GPS sleep)
- Phone should remain stationary in boat
- Displays may not be perfect yet - that's OK!
- Focus on collecting good data

### Ending a Session
1. Click **Stop** button (red)
2. Session auto-saves immediately
3. Repeat for next piece

### Multiple Pieces
- Each piece gets its own session
- No need to export between pieces
- All data saved locally on phone

## After Your Outing

### Export Your Data
1. Click **Sessions**
2. For each session you want:
   - Click **üíæ Export**
   - File downloads as `.wrcdata`
3. Save these files to your computer

### Backup Important Sessions
- Copy .wrcdata files to:
  - Computer
  - Cloud storage
  - Multiple locations (important data!)

### Cleanup
- Delete practice/test sessions
- Keep only good data
- Frees up phone storage

## Troubleshooting on Water

### "Orange banner appeared during recording!"
- **Stop immediately**
- Click "Switch to Real Sensors"
- Start new session
- Previous session has demo data (delete it later)

### "GPS not working"
- Check airplane mode is OFF
- Ensure location permission granted
- Wait 30 seconds for GPS lock (initial fix)
- Move away from obstructions

### "Screen keeps turning off"
- Disable auto-lock in phone settings
- Or tap screen periodically
- Consider "Keep Screen On" app

### "App crashed"
- Restart app
- Current recording lost
- Previous sessions still saved
- Start new session

### "Running out of storage"
- Go to Sessions panel
- Delete old/unnecessary sessions
- Export important sessions first
- Each session contains full raw data (large!)

## What Data is Being Collected?

### IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
- Accelerometer (ax, ay, az)
- Gyroscope (gx, gy, gz)
- ~50 Hz sampling rate
- Captures boat motion

### GPS
- Position (latitude, longitude)
- Speed over ground
- Heading
- Accuracy estimate
- ~1 Hz sampling rate

### Derived Metrics (calculated in app)
- Stroke rate
- Drive percentage
- Roll angle
- Stroke cycle position

All raw data is saved - analysis can be refined later!

## Post-Recording Analysis

### Viewing Your Data
Use Python scripts in repository:
```bash
python visualize_wrcdata.py your_session.wrcdata
```

### Creating GPS Maps
```bash
python create_gps_map.py your_session.wrcdata
```

## Common First-Time Issues (Expected!)

### ‚úì Normal
- Displays look weird/incorrect
- Stroke detection off
- Metrics don't match reality
- Some visual glitches

These are expected! The goal is **data collection**, not perfect display.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Not Normal (Check Settings)
- Orange demo mode banner showing
- No GPS fix after 2+ minutes
- App immediately crashes on start
- No accelerometer data

## Quick Reference

### Button Layout
```
[‚ò∞ Menu]  [WRC Coach]  [‚óè Recording/Ready]

[üìä Sessions] [‚ñ∂ Start] [‚èπ Stop]
```

### Essential Keyboard Shortcuts
- **S** - Open Settings
- **ESC** - Close panels

### Essential Info Locations
- **Demo Mode Status**: Orange banner + Header
- **Recording Status**: Header (red dot when recording)
- **Session List**: Sessions button
- **Settings**: Menu button (‚ò∞) or press S

## Final Pre-Launch Checks

Right before launching:

1. ‚úÖ App open and showing "Ready"
2. ‚úÖ No orange warning banner
3. ‚úÖ Phone orientation set correctly
4. ‚úÖ Plenty of storage space
5. ‚úÖ GPS enabled (airplane mode OFF)
6. ‚úÖ Screen timeout disabled
7. ‚úÖ Phone in waterproof case

**You're ready to collect real rowing data! üö£**

## After Your First Session

Please note:
- What felt right vs what displays showed
- Water conditions (calm/choppy/windy)
- Any unexpected behavior
- Which metrics seemed accurate

This helps tune the algorithms for real boat motion!

**Remember**: Focus on collecting data first, perfecting displays second. Good luck on the water! üåä
