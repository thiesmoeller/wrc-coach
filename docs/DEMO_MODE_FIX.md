# Demo Mode Improvements for Real-World Data Recording

## Problem
User couldn't easily tell if demo mode was active, risking recording simulated data instead of real sensor data on the boat.

## Solution
Added multiple visual indicators to make demo mode status crystal clear:

### 1. **Prominent Warning Banner** (NEW)
- Bright orange/red pulsing banner at top of screen when demo mode is ON
- Shows: "‚ö†Ô∏è DEMO MODE ACTIVE - Using simulated data, not real sensors!"
- Includes **"Switch to Real Sensors"** button for instant disable
- Impossible to miss!

### 2. **Enhanced Settings Panel**
- Demo Mode checkbox now highlights in RED when enabled
- Background pulses red when demo mode is active
- Dynamic help text:
  - **When ON**: "‚ö†Ô∏è Currently using FAKE data! Uncheck this to use real sensors on the boat."
  - **When OFF**: "‚úì Using real phone sensors - perfect for on-water recording!"

### 3. **Header Indicator** (existing)
- Status shows "Demo Mode" instead of "Recording" or "Ready"

## How to Disable Demo Mode

### Method 1: Quick Toggle (NEW)
If you see the orange warning banner:
1. Click **"Switch to Real Sensors"** button
2. Demo mode turns off immediately

### Method 2: Settings Panel
1. Click menu button (‚ò∞) or press 'S'
2. Scroll to "Data Recording" section
3. Uncheck "Demo Mode (Simulated Data)" checkbox
4. Look for green checkmark: "‚úì Using real phone sensors"

### Method 3: Reset All Settings
1. Open Settings (‚ò∞ or press 'S')
2. Scroll to bottom
3. Click "üîÑ Reset to Defaults"
4. Demo mode will be OFF (default is OFF)

## Verification

**How to confirm you're using REAL sensors:**

‚úÖ **No orange warning banner** at top  
‚úÖ Header says "Ready" or "Recording" (NOT "Demo Mode")  
‚úÖ Settings panel shows: "‚úì Using real phone sensors"  
‚úÖ Demo Mode checkbox is UNCHECKED  

**If demo mode is ON, you'll see:**

‚ùå **Bright orange pulsing banner** at top  
‚ùå Header says "Demo Mode"  
‚ùå Settings panel has red highlight  
‚ùå Demo Mode checkbox is CHECKED  

## Default State

- **Demo Mode defaults to OFF** in fresh installs
- Perfect for real-world data collection
- Only enable for testing/demonstration without boat

## Technical Details

**Files Changed:**
- `src/App.tsx` - Added warning banner
- `src/App.css` - Banner styling with pulse animation
- `src/components/SettingsPanel.tsx` - Enhanced demo mode display
- `src/components/SettingsPanel.css` - Red highlight animation

**How it Works:**
- Settings stored in localStorage under `strokeCoachSettings`
- `demoMode: false` is the default
- Toggle updates immediately (no page refresh needed)
- Banner appears/disappears reactively

## For First Real Boat Use

**Pre-launch Checklist:**
1. ‚úÖ Verify NO orange warning banner
2. ‚úÖ Open Settings and confirm demo mode is UNCHECKED
3. ‚úÖ See "‚úì Using real phone sensors" message
4. ‚úÖ Ready to record real data!

**During Recording:**
- If you see the orange banner, STOP immediately
- Click "Switch to Real Sensors"
- Restart your session

This ensures you're collecting actual boat motion, not simulated 25 SPM rowing data!
