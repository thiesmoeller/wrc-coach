# Cleanup Notes - Old Code Removed

## What Was Removed

The old monolithic codebase has been removed. The following files were deleted:

### Deleted Files
- ❌ `app.js` - 2088 lines of monolithic JavaScript
- ❌ `styles.css` - Old CSS styles
- ❌ `sw.js` - Old service worker
- ❌ `manifest.json` - Old PWA manifest

### Backed Up
- 📦 `index-old.html.backup` - Original index.html (kept as backup)

### Renamed
- ✅ `index-vite.html` → `index.html` (now the main entry point)

## Current Structure

The application now runs **exclusively** on the new React + Vite + TypeScript architecture:

```
wrc-coach/
├── index.html              ← Main entry point (React app)
├── src/
│   ├── lib/                ← Extracted algorithm libraries
│   ├── components/         ← React components
│   ├── hooks/              ← Custom hooks
│   ├── App.tsx             ← Main app
│   └── main.tsx            ← Entry point
├── public/                 ← Static assets
├── dist/                   ← Build output
└── tests/                  ← Test files

Legacy backup:
└── index-old.html.backup   ← Original app (for reference)
```

## Why Clean?

1. **No confusion**: Only one codebase to maintain
2. **Simpler deployment**: One build process
3. **Clean git history**: No legacy code mixed in
4. **Faster development**: No old files to navigate

## Migration Complete ✅

All functionality from the old monolithic code has been:
- ✅ Extracted into testable libraries (`src/lib/`)
- ✅ Migrated to React components (`src/components/`)
- ✅ Tested (16 tests passing)
- ✅ Building successfully

## If You Need the Old Code

The complete old implementation is preserved in:
- `index-old.html.backup` - Original entry point
- Git history - All old files are in version control

To restore it:
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 app.js styles.css sw.js manifest.json
```

But you shouldn't need to - everything works better in the new architecture!

## Build & Run

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Tests
npm test

# Production build
npm run build
```

## What's Different Now

### Before (Monolithic)
```
index.html
└── <script src="app.js">  (2088 lines of mixed UI + algorithms)
```

### After (Modular)
```
index.html
└── <script src="/src/main.tsx">
    └── App.tsx
        ├── Components (Header, MetricsBar, etc.)
        └── Libraries (from src/lib/)
            ├── Filters
            ├── Stroke Detection
            ├── Data Storage
            └── Transforms
```

## Status

- ✅ Old code removed
- ✅ New code works
- ✅ Tests passing (16/16)
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ PWA functional

**Clean slate achieved!** 🎉
