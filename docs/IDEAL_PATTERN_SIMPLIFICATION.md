# Ideal Pattern Simplification

## Change Summary

Simplified the ideal pattern overlay in the polar plot to show a clear, easy-to-understand 1/3 drive, 2/3 recovery ratio with stronger acceleration than deceleration.

## What Changed

### Before: Complex Research-Based Pattern
The previous ideal pattern was based on research papers (Kleshnev, Holt et al., Greidanus) with:
- Pre-catch check phase
- Rapid catch transition
- Dual-peak drive pattern (legs â†’ back â†’ arms)
- Multiple transition phases
- Complex calculations with 7 distinct phases

**Result:** Accurate but visually complex and hard to compare against.

### After: Simple 1/3 - 2/3 Pattern
The new ideal pattern shows:
- **1/3 Drive Phase (0-33%):** Strong positive acceleration (sine wave)
- **2/3 Recovery Phase (33-100%):** Gentle negative deceleration (sine wave)
- Clear ratio that's easy to understand and target
- Stronger acceleration than deceleration (80% vs 30% of max)

## Implementation

**File:** `src/components/PolarPlot.tsx`

```typescript
// Simple ideal pattern: 1/3 drive, 2/3 recovery
const peakAccel = maxSurge * 0.8;      // Strong acceleration during drive
const peakDecel = maxSurge * 0.3;      // Gentle deceleration during recovery
const driveRatio = 1/3;                // Drive is 33% of stroke cycle

// DRIVE PHASE (0-33%): Strong positive acceleration
if (cyclePos < driveRatio) {
  const drivePhase = cyclePos / driveRatio;
  surge = peakAccel * Math.sin(drivePhase * Math.PI);
}

// RECOVERY PHASE (33-100%): Gentle negative deceleration  
else {
  const recoveryPhase = (cyclePos - driveRatio) / (1 - driveRatio);
  surge = -peakDecel * Math.sin(recoveryPhase * Math.PI);
}
```

## Technical Details

### Pattern Formula

**Drive Phase (0 â‰¤ t < 1/3):**
```
surge = 0.8 Ã— maxSurge Ã— sin(3Ï€t)
```

**Recovery Phase (1/3 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1):**
```
surge = -0.3 Ã— maxSurge Ã— sin(3Ï€(t - 1/3)/2)
```

### Scaling
- **Peak acceleration:** 80% of maximum observed surge
- **Peak deceleration:** 30% of maximum observed surge
- **Ratio:** 2.67:1 (acceleration:deceleration)

### Smoothness
- Uses `Math.sin()` for natural, smooth transitions
- No sharp corners or discontinuities
- Continuous curve from start to finish

- Clear 1:2 ratio visible âœ“
```

### Long Drive (Too much drive time)
```
User stroke (blue) extends beyond 33%
- Drive phase reaches 45% of cycle âœ—
- Recovery feels rushed âœ—
- Need to: Quicker finish, longer recovery
```

- Drive phase only 20% of cycle âœ—
- Not enough power application âœ—
- Need to: Longer drive, more power
```
