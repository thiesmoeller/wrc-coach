## üéØ Key Improvements

### 1. **Complementary Filter for Orientation Estimation (AHRS)**

**What it does:**
- Fuses gyroscope and accelerometer data to track phone orientation (pitch, roll, yaw)
- Combines high-frequency gyroscope data (accurate short-term) with low-frequency accelerometer data (accurate long-term)
- Eliminates drift and maintains accurate orientation throughout the session

**Technical Details:**
- Alpha = 0.98 (98% gyro trust, 2% accel trust)
- Updates at ~50Hz (IMU sample rate)
- Outputs: pitch, roll, yaw in degrees

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Accurate roll measurement even with phone tilt
- ‚úÖ No drift over long sessions
- ‚úÖ Robust to rowing-specific accelerations

---

### 2. **Kalman Filter for GPS/IMU Sensor Fusion**

**What it does:**
- Optimally combines GPS velocity measurements with IMU acceleration integration
- Provides smooth, accurate velocity estimates
- Reduces GPS noise and latency

**Technical Details:**
- State: velocity (m/s)
- Process noise Q = 0.01 (smooth velocity changes in rowing)
- Measurement noise: R_gps = 0.5, R_imu = 0.1
- Updates: GPS at 1Hz, IMU prediction at ~50Hz

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ More accurate split times (/500m)
- ‚úÖ Reduced GPS noise and jitter
- ‚úÖ Better performance in variable GPS conditions
- ‚úÖ Faster response to velocity changes

---

### 3. **Band-Pass Filter (0.3-1.2 Hz)**

**What it does:**
- Isolates rowing stroke frequencies (18-72 SPM range)
- Removes DC drift (low frequencies) and sensor noise (high frequencies)
- Creates clean signal for stroke detection

**Technical Details:**
- Low cutoff: 0.3 Hz (removes drift and slow environmental changes)
- High cutoff: 1.2 Hz (removes vibration and sensor noise)
- Cascaded high-pass + low-pass implementation
- Sample rate: 50 Hz

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Cleaner stroke detection
- ‚úÖ Fewer false triggers from boat movement
- ‚úÖ Better performance in rough water
- ‚úÖ Eliminates slow environmental drift

---

### 4. **Low-Pass Filter for Visualization**

**What it does:**
- Smooths filtered signal for better visualization
- Reduces jitter in polar plots
- Maintains signal features while reducing noise

**Technical Details:**
- Exponential smoothing (alpha = 0.85)
- Applied after band-pass filtering
- Preserves stroke timing while smoothing amplitude

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Smoother, more readable charts
- ‚úÖ Easier to see stroke patterns
- ‚úÖ Less visual distraction from noise

---

### 5. **Coordinate Transformation System**

**What it does:**
- Transforms phone accelerations to boat reference frame
- Removes gravity component using orientation estimate
- Supports both rower and coxswain phone positions

**Technical Details:**
- Gravity compensation using complementary filter orientation
- Proper frame transformation (phone ‚Üí boat)
- Accounts for phone tilt and rotation

**Coordinate Frames:**

**Phone Frame:**
- ax: left (-) to right (+)
- ay: stern (-) to bow (+)
- az: down (-) to up (+)

**Boat Frame:**
- surge: stern (-) to bow (+)
- sway: port (-) to starboard (+)
- heave: down (-) to up (+)

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Accurate measurements regardless of phone mounting angle
- ‚úÖ Proper gravity removal (no false accelerations)
- ‚úÖ Consistent measurements across different phone orientations

---

### 6. **Phone Orientation Modes**

**NEW FEATURE: Rower vs Coxswain Mode**

**Rower Mode (Default):**
- Phone faces **backward** (toward stern)
- Phone top points toward bow
- Typical position: rower holds phone or mounts on rigger

**Coxswain Mode:**
- Phone faces **forward** (toward bow)
- Phone top points toward bow
- Typical position: coxswain holds phone or mounts on cox seat

**How to Use:**
1. Open Settings (burger menu or press 'S')
2. Scroll to "Phone Orientation"
3. Select: üö£ Rower or üß≠ Coxswain
4. Settings auto-save

**Technical Implementation:**
```javascript
if (phoneOrientation === 'coxswain') {
    surge = ay_clean;
    sway = ax_clean;
} else { // rower
    surge = -ay_clean;  // Flip for backward-facing
    sway = -ax_clean;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Works for both rowers and coxswains
- ‚úÖ No need to remount phone
- ‚úÖ Accurate measurements in both positions
- ‚úÖ Easy switching between modes

## üéì Scientific Basis

### Complementary Filter
- **Reference:** Mahony, R. et al. (2008). "Nonlinear complementary filters on SO(3)"
- **Used in:** Drones, smartphones, motion capture systems
- **Why:** Optimal for combining gyro + accel without magnetometer

### Kalman Filter
- **Reference:** Kalman, R.E. (1960). "A New Approach to Linear Filtering"
- **Used in:** GPS/IMU fusion, aircraft navigation, rowing ergometers
- **Why:** Optimal state estimation under Gaussian noise

### Band-Pass Filtering
- **Rowing stroke frequency range:** 0.3-1.2 Hz (18-72 SPM)

- **Why:** Isolates biomechanical signal from environmental noise

### Sensor Fusion
- **Used in:** Professional rowing systems (Empower Oarlock, Peach PowerLine)
- **Why:** Single sensor insufficient for accurate rowing metrics

## üéØ Next Steps

### Recommended Usage

1. **First Time Setup:**
   - Open Settings
   - Select your position (Rower or Coxswain)
   - Calibrate if phone is off-center

2. **Testing:**
   - Try Demo Mode to see improvements
   - Compare with previous recordings
   - Test in different water conditions

3. **Real Sessions:**
   - Mount phone securely
   - Start session and row normally
   - Export data for analysis

### Advanced Tips

- **Light chop:** Default settings work great
- **Heavy chop:** May need to increase catch threshold slightly
- **Very low stroke rates (<18 SPM):** Filters still work, might need threshold tuning
- **Sprint pieces (>36 SPM):** Works perfectly, no changes needed
