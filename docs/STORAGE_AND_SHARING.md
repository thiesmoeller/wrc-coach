# Session Storage & Sharing

## Storage Location

### Where Sessions Are Stored
- **Browser localStorage** under key: `wrc_coach_sessions`
- **Persists across**:
  - ‚úÖ App restarts
  - ‚úÖ Browser refreshes
  - ‚úÖ PWA updates
  - ‚úÖ Device reboots
  - ‚úÖ Airplane mode
  - ‚úÖ Offline mode

### Data Structure
Each session contains:
```javascript
{
  id: "session_timestamp_randomid",
  timestamp: 1234567890,           // When session was saved
  sessionStartTime: 1234567890,    // When recording started
  duration: 180000,                 // Duration in ms
  samples: [...],                   // All IMU and GPS samples
  avgStrokeRate: 28.5,
  avgDrivePercent: 42.3,
  maxSpeed: 5.2,
  totalDistance: 2500,
  strokeCount: 85,
  phoneOrientation: 'rower',
  demoMode: false,
  catchThreshold: 0.6,
  finishThreshold: -0.3,
  calibrationData: {...}
}
```

### Storage Limits
- **Browser quota**: Typically 5-10 MB per app
- **Auto-cleanup**: Removes oldest session if storage full
- **Manual cleanup**: Delete sessions in Sessions panel

### Data Safety
- **Local only**: Data never leaves your device
- **No cloud sync**: Must manually export to backup
- **Survives app updates**: Data persists through PWA updates
- **Lost if**: Browser cache cleared OR app uninstalled

## Sharing / Export Functionality

### Native Share (Mobile) üì§

On **iOS and Android**, clicking "üì§ Share" opens the native share sheet:

**iOS Options**:
- AirDrop to nearby Mac/iPhone
- Save to Files app
- Share via Messages/Email
- Upload to iCloud Drive
- Send to other apps

**Android Options**:
- Share via Nearby Share / Quick Share
- Save to Google Drive / Dropbox
- Share via WhatsApp/Telegram/Email
- Send via Bluetooth
- Save to Downloads folder

### Traditional Download (Desktop) üíæ

On **desktop browsers**, clicking "üì§ Share":
- Downloads `.wrcdata` file directly
- Saves to your Downloads folder
- Standard browser download behavior

### How It Works

```typescript
// Priority order:
1. Try Web Share API (if available on mobile)
   ‚Üí Opens native share sheet
   ‚Üí User picks destination
   
2. Fallback to download (desktop or if share fails)
   ‚Üí Creates download link
   ‚Üí Auto-downloads file
```

### File Format
- **Filename**: `wrc_coach_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.wrcdata`
- **Type**: Binary format (custom WRC format)
- **Size**: Varies based on session length (typically 100KB - 5MB)
- **Contains**: Full IMU data, GPS data, session metadata

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Share to Computer (iOS)
1. Record session on iPhone
2. Click Sessions ‚Üí üì§ Share on session
3. Select **AirDrop**
4. Choose your Mac
5. File appears in Downloads on Mac

### Scenario 2: Save to Cloud (Android)
1. Record session on Android phone
2. Click Sessions ‚Üí üì§ Share on session
3. Select **Google Drive**
4. Choose folder and save
5. Access from any device

### Scenario 3: Desktop Export
1. Run PWA on desktop browser
2. Record session (or use demo mode)
3. Click Sessions ‚Üí üì§ Share on session
4. File downloads to Downloads folder
5. Analyze with Python scripts

### Scenario 4: Bulk Export
1. After training session with multiple pieces
2. Go through session list
3. Click üì§ Share on each important session
4. Choose same destination (e.g., same folder in Files app)
5. All sessions collected in one place

## Data Backup Best Practices

### Recommended Workflow
1. **During outing**: Focus on recording sessions
2. **After outing**: Share all important sessions to:
   - Computer via AirDrop/cable
   - Cloud storage (Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox)
   - Email to yourself
3. **Once backed up**: Delete old sessions from app to free space

### Why Backup?
- localStorage can be cleared by:
  - User clearing browser cache
  - System storage cleanup (rare)
  - Uninstalling PWA
- **No automatic backup** - you must manually export

### Storage Strategy
**On Device** (temporary):
- Keep recent sessions for quick review
- Delete after backing up
- Monitor storage in Sessions panel

**Off Device** (permanent):
- Cloud storage for long-term
- Computer backup
- Multiple locations for important data

## Checking Storage Status

### How to Monitor
1. Open **Sessions** panel
2. Count number of sessions
3. Note timestamp of oldest session
4. Watch for storage warnings

### Signs of Full Storage
- "Storage full! Please delete some sessions." alert
- Oldest session auto-deleted when saving new one
- Can't save new sessions

### Cleanup Steps
1. Export important sessions first
2. Click üóëÔ∏è Delete on old/test sessions
3. Use "Clear All" for complete reset (careful!)
4. Verify space freed by saving test session

## Technical Details

### Web Share API Support
- **iOS Safari**: ‚úÖ Full support (iOS 12.2+)
- **Android Chrome**: ‚úÖ Full support
- **Desktop Chrome**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited (some platforms)
- **Desktop Safari**: ‚ùå No file sharing
- **Firefox**: ‚ùå Falls back to download

### localStorage Limits by Browser
- **Safari (iOS)**: ~5 MB
- **Chrome (Android)**: ~10 MB
- **Desktop browsers**: ~10 MB
- **Actual limit**: Depends on available device storage

### What Happens When Full?
```javascript
1. Try to save session
2. localStorage.setItem() throws QuotaExceededError
3. App catches error
4. Removes oldest session automatically
5. Retries save
6. If still fails, shows alert
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Share button does nothing"
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure file is not too large (>10MB)
- Try different share target
- Fallback: Use desktop to download instead

### "Session disappeared after restart"
- Check if browser cache was cleared
- Verify app was properly closed (not force-closed)
- Check browser's "Clear on exit" settings
- **Prevention**: Export immediately after important sessions

### "Can't share to specific app"
- App may not accept `.wrcdata` files
- Workaround: Share to Files app first, then forward
- Or: Share via email (accepts any file type)

### "Storage full despite deleting sessions"
- Browser cache may need refresh
- Close and reopen PWA
- Check browser storage settings
- Last resort: Clear site data (loses all sessions!)

## Migration & Updates

### PWA Updates
- Sessions survive app updates ‚úÖ
- New app version loads existing sessions
- No data migration needed

### Browser Changes
- Switching browsers loses data ‚ùå
- Moving devices loses data ‚ùå
- **Must export before switching**

### Data Portability
- Export all sessions before:
  - Changing phones
  - Switching browsers  
  - Major OS updates
  - Uninstalling PWA

## Future Enhancements (Potential)

- [ ] Cloud sync option
- [ ] Automatic backup to cloud
- [ ] Session import from file
- [ ] Multiple session export (zip)
- [ ] Storage usage indicator
- [ ] Export to CSV/JSON formats

**Key Takeaway**: Sessions are stored locally in your browser and survive restarts, but you MUST export important sessions to ensure long-term backup!
