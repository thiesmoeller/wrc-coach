# Research-Based Optimal Rowing Pattern

## Overview

The demo mode and ideal pattern overlay now implement research-based optimal rowing technique, based on:
- **Kleshnev** - Dual-peak drive pattern analysis
- **Holt et al. (2021)** - Acceleration features correlated with boat speed
- **Greidanus** - Energy cost of velocity fluctuations
- **PLOS, rowinginmotion.com, Archinisis** - Optimal stroke cycle characteristics

## Optimal Stroke Cycle Phases

### 1. Pre-Catch Check (0-5% of cycle, ~0.0-0.12s @ 25 SPM)
```
Pattern: Minimal unavoidable deceleration
Magnitude: -0.5 m/s² peak
Goal: "As narrow and shallow as possible" - PLOS
```

**Why it exists:**
- Rower mass shifting forward on slide
- Body preparing for catch
- Inevitable physics of boat/rower system

**Optimization:**
- Keep duration short (< 5% of cycle)
- Minimize magnitude (< 0.5 m/s²)
- Soft, controlled approach

### 2. Catch Transition (5-8% of cycle, ~0.12-0.19s @ 25 SPM)
```
Pattern: Rapid reversal from decel to positive accel
Magnitude: -0.5 → +3.0 m/s² in ~0.07s
Goal: "Cross zero acceleration quickly" - rowinginmotion
```

**Technique points:**
- Sharp blade entry (no splashing/crashing)
- Immediate connection (blade → handle → body)
- Leg drive initiation

**Common faults:**
- Too slow: Wastes time at low speed
- Too aggressive: "Crash at catch", disrupts boat

### 3. Drive Phase (8-35% of cycle, ~0.19-0.84s @ 25 SPM)

#### a. First Peak - Leg Drive (8-19% of cycle)
```
Pattern: Rising acceleration to first peak
Magnitude: 0 → 3.2 m/s²
Goal: "Legs are strongest, apply maximum force early" - Kleshnev
```

#### b. Transition - Legs → Back (19-21% of cycle)
```
Pattern: Slight dip between peaks
Magnitude: 3.2 → 2.8 m/s²
Reason: Biomechanical sequencing (legs finish → back takes over)
```

#### c. Second Peak - Back + Arms (21-35% of cycle)
```
Pattern: Secondary rise in acceleration
Magnitude: 2.8 → 3.0 m/s²
Goal: "Maintain continuous positive acceleration" - ResearchGate
```

**Dual-peak pattern:**
- First peak: Leg drive (strongest muscles)
- Small dip: Transition phase (normal, not a fault)
- Second peak: Back and arms complete the stroke
- Documented by Kleshnev in elite rowers

**Common faults:**
- Flat spots: Loss of momentum mid-drive
- Too early back: Using weaker muscles first
- Disconnection: Gap between leg and back drive

### 4. Finish/Extraction (35-40% of cycle, ~0.84-0.96s @ 25 SPM)
```
Pattern: Clean taper, minimal reverse acceleration
Magnitude: 2.6 → -0.3 m/s²
Goal: "Finish cleanly, minimize losses" - Archinisis
```

**Technique points:**
- Clean blade extraction (no dragging)
- Hands away immediately
- No abrupt deceleration

**Common faults:**
- Abrupt extraction: Creates negative spike
- Delayed hands: Holds blade in water too long
- Jerky movement: Disrupts boat momentum

### 5. Early Recovery (40-75% of cycle, ~0.96-1.80s @ 25 SPM)
```
Pattern: Minimal deceleration, preserve forward velocity
Magnitude: -0.25 m/s² peak
Goal: "Smooth and controlled, minimal force impulses" - rowinginmotion
```

**Sequencing (critical):**
1. Hands away first
2. Body swing second
3. Slide forward last

**Why this matters:**
- Rower mass moves forward relative to boat
- Poor sequencing = wasted energy
- Smooth = boat maintains speed

**Common faults:**
- Rushed hands: Too fast to front stops
- Early slide: Moving mass before body set
- Jerky movement: Creates unwanted decelerations

### 6. Late Recovery/Approach (75-100% of cycle, ~1.80-2.40s @ 25 SPM)
```
Pattern: Soft approach to catch, controlled deceleration
Magnitude: -0.15 to -0.40 m/s²
Goal: "Soft approach, set up for clean catch" - Archinisis
```

**Balance:**
- Too slow: Wastes time, loses momentum
- Too fast: Crash at catch, rushed
- Just right: Controlled, prepared, smooth entry

```

### Compared to Ideal (green dashed):
- **Pre-catch check**: Small dip before 0s
- **Rapid rise**: Sharp transition at catch
- **Dual peaks**: Legs, then back+arms
- **Clean finish**: Smooth taper
- **Minimal recovery**: Near-zero deceleration
- **Soft approach**: Controlled to next catch

## Key Metrics

### Optimal Values (from research):

| Phase | Duration | Peak Accel/Decel | Notes |
|-------|----------|------------------|-------|
| Check | < 5% cycle | -0.3 to -0.5 m/s² | Minimize |
| Drive | 30-35% cycle | +2.5 to +4.0 m/s² | May show dual peak |
| Finish | < 5% cycle | +2 to -0.5 m/s² | Clean taper |
| Recovery | 55-65% cycle | -0.2 to -0.5 m/s² | Preserve velocity |

### Energy Efficiency (Greidanus):
- Every deceleration requires re-acceleration
- Drag varies nonlinearly with speed
- Velocity fluctuations cost extra energy
- **Goal: Minimize unwanted decelerations**

### Performance Correlations (Holt et al. 2021):
- Acceleration peak magnitude → boat speed ✓
- Timing of peaks relative to cycle → efficiency ✓
- Jerk (rate of change) → technique quality ✓
- Smoother = faster (for same power/rate)

## How Demo Mode Demonstrates This

### What You'll See:
1. **Small pre-catch dip** (check)
2. **Sharp rise** at catch
3. **Dual-peak drive** pattern
4. **Clean finish** transition
5. **Flat recovery** (minimal decel)
6. **Controlled approach** to next catch

### Teaching Points:
- **Check size**: Compare to ideal (should be minimal)
- **Drive smoothness**: Look for continuous positive acceleration
- **Recovery efficiency**: Should be nearly flat
- **Overall shape**: Should match research-based ideal pattern

## Comparison: Old vs Research-Based

### Old Demo Mode:
- Simple sine wave
- Single peak
- 40% drive (rushed recovery)
- No check or transition details

### Research-Based Demo Mode:
- ✓ Pre-catch check
- ✓ Rapid catch transition
- ✓ Dual-peak drive (Kleshnev)
- ✓ Clean finish
- ✓ Minimal recovery deceleration
- ✓ 33% drive (optimal)
